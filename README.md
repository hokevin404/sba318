SBA 318: 
Express Server Application

This assessment measures your understanding of Node and Express and your capability 
to implement their features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the 
topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have 
fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline 
you have been given.

My application tries to mimic that of an E-commerce website that has users be able 
to view, create, update, and/or delete listings. The "database" holds user 
infomation, listings, and user reviews.
